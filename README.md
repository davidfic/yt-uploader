## Youtube uploader

Simple project to take movie files on your computer and upload them to your
Youtube account.


Lots of improvements need to be made.

This adds a random string for the title so there is at least something there.
Also this defaults to setting everything as private. 


### Requirements

I used a project called [Youtube-upload](https://github.com/tokland/youtube-upload)

You will need to grab that project and follow the very easy to understand instructions
on how to set it up.
